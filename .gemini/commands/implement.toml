# Implementing a Feature

- Implement the feature as specified in the provided feature specification file.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Ensure that the implementation adheres to best practices and coding standards.

## Implementation strategy

- Review the feature specification file thoroughly to understand the
  requirements and expected outcomes.
- Using TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles, write unit tests for the
  feature before implementing the actual code.
- Implement the feature incrementally, working through the development tasks
  outlined in the specification one at a time. Use a to-do list to track
  progress.
- After completing the implementation, review the code for quality, readability,
  and adherence to the specification.
- Follow the test plan provided in the specification to verify that the feature
  works as intended and meets all requirements.
- Validate that every requirement is covered by tests, ensuring that the
  feature is robust and reliable.
- When writing tests, annotate each test case with a comment that references
  the specific feature and requirement it is intended to validate.
